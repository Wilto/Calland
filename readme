Spent today messin’ around with responsive images, and thought I might try a back-end approach—it actually started to look kind of promising, so I may as well throw my scratch paper up here, yeah?

So, the basic idea is that the .htaccess file intercepts the request for the image file and forwards the path along to img.php, which potentially generates and caches a smaller version of the image depending on the screen size set in the ‘rwd-viewport’ cookie via JS.

Obviously this is still rough. I'm just resizing to 25% on smaller screen sizes because it was the first thing that came to mind, but that should probably be a little more... User-settable.

Should it generate and store the images on the server for access later? Let us think on this.
