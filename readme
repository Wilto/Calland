Spent today messin’ around with responsive images, and thought I might try a back-end approach—it actually started to look kind of promising, so I may as well throw my scratch paper up here, yeah?

So, the basic idea is that the .htaccess file intercepts the request for the image file and forwards the path along to img.php, which potentially generates and caches a smaller version of the image depending on the screen size set in the ‘rwd-viewport’ cookie via JS.

Obviously this is still rough. Couple of notes:

I'm just resizing to 25% on smaller screen sizes because it was the first thing that came to mind, but that should probably be a little more... User-settable. Also, images should never be resized to larger than the device's screen width—there's no need to only restrict us to "small" and "large" images with this approach, right?

Should it generate and store the images on the server for access later? Let us think on this.

Here's the big thing: I'm not sure how I feel about delivering the mobile images to users with cookies disabled. Granted it's a better approach than potentially throwing monster images at users on a Nokia 6230, but... Still, there has to be some way of providing a fall-back method for passing the viewport information along to the backend.
